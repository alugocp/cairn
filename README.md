## Cairn
Cairn is a simple PHP site build script written for use in several LugoCorp web projects. But now you too can build your PHP-templated websites with a single command! Cairn adapts to your project layout, processing every `index.php` into a corresponding `index.html` in a provided build folder.

## Installation
To install Cairn as a system-wide command simply run the following:

```bash
sudo cp cairn.sh /usr/bin/cairn
```
